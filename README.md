# KRequest

## Introduction

KRequest is a **Declarative** HTTP client/Kotlin Symbol Processor using KSP and OkHttp3

## Status  ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Development-8A2BE2)

In fact, KRequest is still under **Development**, and the following are the available annotations.

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/KRequest-API-blue) The API annotation indicates that the annotated
interface is a network request interface, which needs to be implemented by KRequest.

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTTP_Method-GET-Green) The GET annotation indicates KRequest use HTTP GET
request, with the parameter uri.

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTTP_Method-POST-Green) The POST annotation indicates KRequest use HTTP
POST request, with the parameter uri.

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Parameter-Path-yellow) The Path annotation indicates KRequest use find a
path variable with the same name in the annotation paramteter and use this variable to replace it.

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Parameter-PostBody-yellow) The PostBody annotation indicates KRequest will
use this annotated variable as the request body.

## Usage

Let's understand the usage of KRequest through an example. When we need to access a GitHub API with the
URL https://api.github.com/users/{login}, where {login} represents the username parameter, we use the HTTP GET method
and the response body is converted to GitUser.

```kotlin
data class GitUser(
    val id: Int,
    val login: String,
    val url: String
)

val client = OkHttpClient()

val login = "your_github_username"
val url = "https://api.github.com/users/$login"

val request = Request.Builder()
    .url(url)
    .build()

return client.newCall(request).execute().use { response ->
    if (response.isSuccessful) {
        val user = Gson().fromJson(response.body?.string(), GitUser::class.java)
        return@use user
    } else {
        return@use null
    }
}
```

This is a standard implementation of a network request using OkHttp, but it contains too much information about the
implementation. We neither need nor want to know how it's implemented. We can describe our API in a simpler way and then
let KRequest help us implement it.

```kotlin
@Api
interface GitHubApi {
    @GET("/users/{login}")
    fun getUser(@Path("login") login: String): GitUser?
}
```

Then, we use the **createAPI** function to obtain its implementation, and then enjoy using it freely.

```kotlin
val githubApi = createAPI<GitHubApi>("https://api.github.com", OkHttpClient())
val user = githubApi.getUser("llonvne")
```

Sometimes, overly magical behaviors might make users feel puzzled. For KRequest, just search for '
{YourApiClassName}Impl', and you can find the implementation class that KRequest generates for you. In fact, it's no
different from the implementation class you would write directly!

```kotlin
public fun Apis.GitHubApi(baseUrl: String, okHttpClient: OkHttpClient): GitHubApi =
    GitHubApiImpl(baseUrl, okHttpClient)

@GeneratedCode("Generated by KRequest")
private class GitHubApiImpl(
    private val baseUrl: String,
    private val okHttpClient: OkHttpClient,
) : GitHubApi {
    public override fun getUser(login: String): GitUser? {
        val request = Request.Builder()
            .get()
            .url("" + baseUrl + "/users/" + login + "")
            .build()
        val resp = okHttpClient.newCall(request)
            .execute()
        return converter(resp)
    }
}
```
